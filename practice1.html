    My name is Ike and I am a sophomore majoring in computer science at the university of Kansas. I have taken multiple programming courses in Python, some in C and C++, and one in
    JavaScript and HTML. Some of the projects and events I have participated in - both in and out of school - include programming a small self-driving car, creating my own 
    asteroids-like video game, and attending the annual KU Hackathon.<br><br>
